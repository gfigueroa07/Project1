Make a function called input_to_int that takes one argument. The argument is a string with the question to ask the user:
The function must do the following:
- Take input from the user
- Check if input is a valid number

One of the following implementations:
- Return the number if valid and Return _None_  if not valid (datatype that represents literally nothing)
OR
- Return the number if valid and ask again if not valid.
- The user **must** have the choice of stopping this and the program returns _None_.

Tips:
- The function call can be assigned to a variable directly, just like you do with any other.
```py
# eg. variable1 = print("what do?")
```
- The function returns either a number or _None_.
- Remember, you are making this function so you can use it anywhere that you need a number from the user, without the hassle of validating that input manually every single time with Try-Except blocks. You just call the function and trust it will do what it has to do, and return what it has to. 
__When you call it anywhere in your code all you have to do is check what was returned and act accordingly.__
